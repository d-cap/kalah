# Getting Started

## Description
This is an implementation of the Kalah game. The current implementation uses Spring Boot to serve the functionalities.

### Run the application
`KalahApplication` is responsible for starting the web service.

To start the application you can use one of the following commands:
- `mvn spring-boot:run` (_Development environment only_)
- `java -jar kalah-<version>.jar`

### Endpoints
Currently, there are two endpoints available with the `POST` http method:
- One to create a game`http://<host>:8080/games`
- One to make a move `http://<host>:8080/games/{gameId}/pits/{pitId}`
  - `gameId` is generated by the application
  - `pitId` is fixed between game and should be in one of these two intervals: [1, 6] or [8, 13]

### Package division
- `api` contains the classes that are used to expose the game
- `api.response` contains the classes used as a response for the APIs
- `game` contains the actual logic for the game

### Note
- The file `lombok.config` is used to configure Lombok to expose the constructor properties' name to allow Jackson to deserialise the object into json.
